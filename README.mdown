**Vagrant Rails**

This is my general vagrant rails setup.

Comes with

1. RVM
1. Rails
1. Postgres


This assumes that you have a rails project initiated in the same directory where the Vagrantfile and vagrantup.sh are located. 
If not, you can remove everything from the command "bundle" down and set it up yourself.
